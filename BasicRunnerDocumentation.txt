There are two runners, 

runnerOH.m
and
runnerPD.m. 

They are different to avoid changing directories each time they need to execute. 
They perform the following tasks:
1. clear pData.mat
2. call saveSignals.m repeatedly, which is explained later
3. loads pData.mat
4. sorts it according to the names
5. saves pData
6. calls compMetrics.m, which is explained later. 
For PD there are extra steps:
7. call readScale.m, to read the UPDRS
8. call keepCommonWithUPDRS to keep only the PD patients for whom there are UPDRS assessments.

saveSignals.m:
Takes a name and a folder. The name is actually a folder, so it runs separately for each 
participant and appends his/her signals to pData.mat

compMetrics.m:
comp stands for computed. It calculates the metrics from the signals (pData.mat). 
It deletes uComMetrics and pComMetrics because these are created later on by correlation.m. 
They are the intersection of uMetrics and pMetrics
