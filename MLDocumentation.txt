The file responsible for calculating all classification in the jBHI paper is

classification_baggedTree.m

In this file, different schemes of training and testing were implemented. 

No cross-correlation or percentage split was applied at the final model because the 
algorithm used was a bagged forest of decision trees, so the out of bag error was used 
as a validation criteria. 

Matlab's TreeBagger class was used to create the model and then the TreeBagger.oobPredict 
(out of bag prediction) was used to test the model.
